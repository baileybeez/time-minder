# TimeMinder

A full stack javascript timeclock webapp 

## QuickStart

To get up and running, you'll need to setup your environment: 

```console
yarn install
```

After that, you'll need to setup your configuration (named: config.js). You can find an example config in [./config-example.js](./config-example.js). Currently, TimeMinder requires an MSSQL database in order to connect to for data storage. Details of the table requirements can be found in [Models](./core/model/)

Then, just run:
```console
yarn start
```
